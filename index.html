Vocabulary and grammar should be genuinely challenging — upper-intermediate to advanced structures, collocations, and idiomatic expressions. Avoid trivially easy items.

CRITICAL: Respond ONLY with raw valid JSON. No markdown, no backticks, no explanation before or after.

Rules:
- The answer must be completely unambiguous
- For MULTIPLE CHOICE: the "answer" field must be the LETTER (A, B, C, or D), not the word itself
- For KEY WORD TRANSFORMATION: candidate fills 3–8 words INCLUDING the key word (unchanged)
- VARIETY IS ESSENTIAL: every exercise must use a completely different sentence, topic, grammar point, and vocabulary area.

Rules for distractors: real English words/phrases that are semantically related or easily confused with the target word but clearly wrong in context. Same difficulty level (C1-C2).
Rules for example: the blank must be exactly _____ (five underscores). Sentence should make the answer inferable from context but not trivially obvious.`;
